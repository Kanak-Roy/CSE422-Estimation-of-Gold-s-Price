# CSE422-Estimation-of-Gold-s-Price
In this project, we obtained a dataset of gold prices from Kaggle containing gold prices for several days over a ten-year time frame, which we will use to train our machine learning algorithm so that when we train this algorithm and give it a new value, it can predict the gold prices for that specific value.
